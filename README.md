raxi-dns (v0.0.1)
=========

Rackspace Cloud DNS Interactive Command Line

Introduction
============
This is an very early release (in case the 0.0.1 version number wasn't explicit enough), so **expect** things to break and/or not work as expected. In a sense, this is more of a proof-of-concept than an actual product.

Installation
=============
 * First, install coffee globally if you haven't done so (i.e. `npm install -g coffee-script`)
 * Install globally from npm (`npm install -g raxi-dns`) 
 

Usage
======
 * Run `raxi-dns` in a command line and follow the prompts on screen.
